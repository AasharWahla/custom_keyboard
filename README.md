# Custom Keyboard

"Custom Keyboard" is a plugin that you can use in your project with 100% control over it.
Hi, I am Aashar Wahla (https://www.aasharwahla.com). A developer, working with Flutter since v0.8.
I was recently working on a personal project and had to make a custom keyboard. I was unable to find any custom package for that, so I decided to make my package public.
